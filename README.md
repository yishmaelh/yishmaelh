### "You mustn't let the mistakes of the past weigh you down. Acknowledge them and take what you've learned to move on. That is the privilege of being a man." - Full Frontal, Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn

My name is Yishmael, but I go by Yish, with a silent "Y." I spent two years in Japan, and have made trips to Korea, Thailand, and the Phillippines. I transitioned into software development when I decided to teach myself on Codecademy last year; my plan was to be self taught and eventually make my own game. What was meant to be a hobby quickly became a passion, and I found myself wanting to pursue a career as a developer.
